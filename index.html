	<u>A little bit about me</u>:
	<p>As a kid, I spent most of my time playing basketball and had a dream of becoming a professional NBA player, but the field of psychology captivated me. Now I'm 27 years old, I hold a Bachelor of Science in Psychobiology from <a href="https://www.bgu.ac.il/" target="_blank">Ben-Gurion University</a>.
	Building on this, I decided to pursue a Master of Science in Clinical Psychology which I am currently doing at the <a href="https://www.unipd.it/" target="_blank">University of Padova</a>,
	where I am able to hone my skills in diagnosing and treating various psychological conditions, before continuing to specialization school in that field.<p>This year i decided to also learn QA in order to pursue a position in that field, because in QA,
	kind of like in therapy (but not really), I will be able to help the engineer of the app (or the mind) find where there might be problem(s) in order for them to fix the program and make it work better :)</p>
	</p>
	<p>Some of my hobbies include hiking and lifting weights. They are without a doubt my favorite free-time activities and I workout almost every day.
	I also absolutely love reading books, and <a href="booklist.html">here</a> you can find a list of my all-time favorite ones! I also love traveling, and discovering new cultures, foods, languages and places is fascinating to me!
