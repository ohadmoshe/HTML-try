	<u>A little bit about me:</u>
	<p>I'm 27 years old, I hold a Bachelor of Science in Psychobiology from <a href="https://www.bgu.ac.il/" target="_blank">Ben-Gurion University</a>.
	Building on this, I decided to pursue a Master of Science in Clinical Psychology which I am currently doing at the <a href="https://www.unipd.it/" target="_blank">University of Padova</a>,
	where I can hone my skills in diagnosing and treating various psychological conditions.<br>This year i decided to also learn QA in order to pursue a position in that field, because in QA,
	just like in therapy (but not really), I will be able to help the engineer of the app (or the mind) find where there might be problem(s) in order for them to fix the program and make it work better :)
	</p>
	<p><u>Hobbies</u>:
	<p>Hiking and lifting weights are without a doubt my favorite free-time activities and I workout almost every day. I also absolutely love reading books,
	and <a href="booklist.html">here</a> you can find a list of my all-time favorite ones!
